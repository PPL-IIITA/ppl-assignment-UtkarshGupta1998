  Runnable jar files of respective questions are present in the main folder of the respective questions for eg jar file of PPLQuest_3 is     present just inside this folder.                                                                                                     
• Then type java -jar "PPLQuest_1.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_1.                                                                    type java -jar "PPLQuest_2.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_2.                                                                    type java -jar "PPLQuest_3.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_3.                                                                    type java -jar "PPLQuest_4.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_4.                                                                    type java -jar "PPLQuest_5.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_5.                                                                    type java -jar "PPLQuest_7.jar" in command line to execute PPLQuest_7.

• The LOG files will be generated in the same folder in which jar file is present.                                                         
• DOCUMENTATION is present in dist/javadoc/index-files folder of each question, open index-1.html to view.                                 
                                                                                                                                           
The csv files of respective questions are present in the main folder of the respective questions eg csv files of PPLQuest_3 sre present just inside this folder.
